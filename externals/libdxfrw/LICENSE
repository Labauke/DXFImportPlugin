libdxfrw is a free C++ library to read and write DXF files in both formats, ascii and binary form. It also has rudimentary capabilities to read DWG files. It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (or at you option any later version).

libdxfrw was created by LibreCAD contributors in the process of making LibreCAD. As the original code at SourceForge was no longer supported by the orignal authors, this repo has become its successor.
